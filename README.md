Fourier_Analysis_Digital_Images
===============================
The goal of this Fourier analysis exercise is to understand the Fourier analysis itself alongside some applications mainly focused on magnitude and phase. 
Two main exercises will be discussed in this report, first the template matching using Symmetric Phase Only Matched Filters (SPOMF) and Image Registration with Fourier-Mellin Invariant (FMI) â€“ SPOMF.
